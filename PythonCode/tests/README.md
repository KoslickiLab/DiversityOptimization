# Description
This folder will contain a collection of very short scripts that call either:
1. The functions in the modules in `src` and test their input/output on known data so you can verify they are producing what you think they should be producing
2. The command line programs in `scripts` to make sure they are parsing the input data correctly, executing without error, and producing known (pre-computed) results.
